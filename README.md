This is a source code of [my homepage](http://paulmillr.com). To compile it, you'll need to install
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and then to simply execute `make`.
Local webserver will be started on `localhost:4000`.

To compile russian posts to markdown (something jekyll wonâ€™t for us), do `make build`.
