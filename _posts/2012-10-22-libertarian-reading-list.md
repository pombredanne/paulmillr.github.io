Here’s a list of books and articles about libertarianism / anarcho-capitalism which I recommend. It will be updating constantly.

## Basics

You can read the basics of the philosophy in [anarcho-capitalist FAQ](http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/faq.html).

## Books

1. [**Walter Block — Defending the undefendable**](http://mises.org/document/3490/Defending-the-Undefendable) — a tale on negative social / economic issues with governments prohibitions. Block defends pimps, drug dealers, blackmailers, corrupt policemen, and loan sharks as "economic heroes".
2. **David Bergland — Libertarianism in one lesson** — the basics about libertarian philosophy.
3. **David Friedman — The Machinery of Freedom** — utilitarian consequentialist view on anarcho-capitalism. David defends ancap because it is more effective, not because it is moral or something.
4. [**Murray Rothbard — What Has Government Done to Our Money?**](http://mises.org/document/617/What-Has-Government-Done-to-Our-Money) — the not-so-brief history of economics in XIX-XX centuries. How central banks fucked up all the shit, how the gold standard was fucked up.
5. [**Murray Rothbard — The Ethics of Liberty**](http://mises.org/document/1179/The-Ethics-of-Liberty). Describes ethics of libertarian philosophy, natural rights (freedoms). Contains a bit about rights of mother on her child and responses to consequentialist critics of non-aggression principle. Pretty similar to the previous book, although less interesting.
6. [**Hans-Hermann Hoppe — Myth of National Defense**](http://mises.org/document/1092/Myth-of-National-Defense-The-Essays-on-the-Theory-and-History-of-Security-Production). Book tells about inefficiency of states as security providers, historicity of the State, describes how state-less societies may defend themselves from states; private free-market defense / law production and debunkes myth that democracy is more peaceful than other forms of government.

Less interesting, but still neat books:

* [**Walter Block — The Privatization of Roads and Highways**](http://mises.org/document/4084/The-Privatization-of-Roads-and-Highways). Big (~1K pages) book about benefits & detailed description of how roads will function if they will be freed from government monopolies.

Very good research of organised violence in post-USSR Russia, very similar to free market private defence agencies. Provides some insights and facts on how private law could actually work today.

## Fiction books

* [Alex Rozov — Meganezia](http://lib.rus.ec/b/122647) (russian). Book series about a fictional future libertarian state Meganesia. The action takes place in the 2040-2050. All the books, except the first one are very large (~1.5K-2.5K pages). Contains a lot of interesting science fiction (esp. about space exploration and genetic engineering).

## P.S.

Anarchy, n. 4. a theory which regards the union of order with the absence of all direct or coercive government as the political ideal. 5. confusion in general; disorder. (The american college dictionary)

Government produces all order.

Under anarchy there is no government.

Therefore anarchy is chaos.

---------------

In Washington there isn’t any plan

With “feeding David” on page sixty-four;

It must be accidental that the milk man

Leaves a bottle at my door.

It must be accidental that the butcher

Has carcasses arriving at his shop

The very place where, when I need some meat,

I accidentally stop.

My life is chaos turned miraculous;

I speak a word and people understand

Although it must be gibberish since words

Are not produced by governmental plan.

Now law and order, on the other hand

The state provides us for the public good;

That’s why there’s instant justice on demand

And safety in every neighborhood.
