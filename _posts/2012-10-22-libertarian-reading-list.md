Here’s a list of books and articles about libertarianism / anarcho-capitalism which I recommend. It will be updating constantly.

#### Basics

You can read the basics of the philosophy in [anarcho-capitalist FAQ](http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/faq.html).

#### Books

1. [**Walter Block — Defending the undefendable**](http://mises.org/document/3490/Defending-the-Undefendable) — a tale on negative social / economic issues with governments prohibitions. Block defends pimps, drug dealers, blackmailers, corrupt policemen, and loan sharks as "economic heroes".
2. **David Bergland — Libertarianism in one lesson** — the basics about libertarian philosophy.
3. [**Murray Rothbard — What Has Government Done to Our Money?**](http://mises.org/document/617/What-Has-Government-Done-to-Our-Money) — the not-so-brief history of economics in XIX-XX centuries. How central banks fucked up all the shit, how the gold standard was fucked up.
4. [**Murray Rothbard — The Ethics of Liberty**](http://mises.org/document/1179/The-Ethics-of-Liberty). Describes ethics of libertarian philosophy, natural rights (freedoms). Contains a bit about rights of mother on her child and responses to consequentialist critics of non-aggression principle. Pretty similar to the previous book, although less interesting.
5. [**Hans-Hermann Hoppe — Myth of National Defense**](http://mises.org/document/1092/Myth-of-National-Defense-The-Essays-on-the-Theory-and-History-of-Security-Production). Book tells about inefficiency of states as security providers, historicity of the State, describes how state-less societies may defend themselves from states; private free-market defense / law production and debunkes myth that democracy is more peaceful than other forms of government.

Less interesting, but still neat books:

* [**Walter Block — The Privatization of Roads and Highways**](http://mises.org/document/4084/The-Privatization-of-Roads-and-Highways). Big (~1K pages) book about benefits & detailed description of how roads will function if they will be freed from government monopolies.

Very good research of organised violence in post-USSR Russia, very similar to free market private defence agencies. Provides some insights and facts on how private law could actually work today.

#### Fiction books

* [Alex Rozov — Meganezia](http://lib.rus.ec/b/122647) (russian). Book series about a fictional future libertarian state Meganesia. The action takes place in the 2040-2050. All the books, except the first one are very large (~1.5K-2.5K pages). Contains a lot of interesting science fiction (esp. about space exploration and genetic engineering).
